## üì¶ About

**`espirion-themes`** contains pre-defined themes using semantic CSS custom properties. Themes are powered by values from [`espirion-tokens`](https://github.com/Espirion/espirion-tokens) and map to design languages such as:

- GitHub (Light & Dark)
- Google Material (Upcoming)
- Microsoft Fluent (Upcoming)

Themes are **decoupled from component logic** and can be switched dynamically via attributes or programmatic control.
